	<p>From this window we can test the functioning of the SubBytes operation, during which a non linear substitution is performed in which each byte is replaced with another one in correspondence with a search table.</p>
	<p>In the input field we can fill in each cell of the matrix as a pair of hexadecimal values. To enter these values we can do it manually, pasting the content from the clipboard or generating a random matrix by pressing the "Random" button.</p>

	<p>By pressing the button "Run" it will be verified that all values are correct and will perform the transformation if so.</p>
	<p>By pressing the "Back" button we return to the operations window.</p>	
	
	<p>From the "Edit" menu we can access different actions relative to the copy and paste operations of the matrices.</p>
