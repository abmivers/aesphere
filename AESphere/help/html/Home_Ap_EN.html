	<p>From this simple home window, the user can access each one of the tools that are available in AESphere.</p>
	<p>By pressing each one of the icons that appear in the window you will be able to move through each window of the application. These buttons are: <br><br>
	<img style="border-width: 0px;" src="resources/lock2.png" width="30" height="29" /> : With this button we access to the window corresponding to the <a href="Cifrado_Ap_EN.html">encryption</a> process, with all its configuration options. <br>
	<img style="border-width: 0px;" src="resources/unlock3.png" width="30" height="30" /> : With this button we can access the <a href="Descifrado_AP_EN.html">decryption</a> window, in which we will be able to configure every detail of the process.<br>
	<img style="border-width: 0px;" src="resources/ataques.png" width="30" height="29" /> : With this button we can simulate a brute force atack based on a Server - Client scheme.<br>
	
	<img style="border-width: 0px;" src="resources/herramientas.png" width="30" height="30" /> : With this button we can test the functioning of the operations in which the AES encryption algorithm consist. </p>
	
	<p>Thank to the language buttons at the bottom - left side of the window we will be able to change the language of the application in real time, saving our choice for future accesses to AESphere.</p>
	
	<p> There is another button left. With the button "Check Vectors" we will be able to check the correct functioning of the implemented AES algorithm by using the test vectors provided by the original RFC of this algorithm</p>
