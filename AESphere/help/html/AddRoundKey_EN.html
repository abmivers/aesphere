	<h1>AddRoundKey</h1>
	<p>In this step of the encryption, the subkey is combined with the state (the 4x4 matrix that uses the AES algorithm for performing the transformations). During each round, a new subkey is derived from the main key using the Rijndael key schedule; each subkey is also a 4x4 matrix, so that the corresponding combinations with the state can be performed. <br>
	The subkey is obtained by combining each byte of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using the XOR operation.<p>
